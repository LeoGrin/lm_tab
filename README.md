## Data
Edited datasets can be downloaded at https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Datasets_with_text_entries/24879042

## Reproducing results
Computations can be launched using the files in the scripts directory starting by `launch_` and `encode`. These scripts are made for a SLURM cluster and should be adapted to your cluster.

## Reproducing figures
Figures can be reproduced using the `final_plot.ipynb` notebook in the `scripts` folder.
